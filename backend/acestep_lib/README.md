## 📝 Abstract

We introduce ACE-Step, a novel open-source foundation model for music generation that overcomes key limitations of existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance through a holistic architectural design. Current methods face inherent trade-offs between generation speed, musical coherence, and controllability. For instance, LLM-based models (e.g., Yue, SongGen) excel at lyric alignment but suffer from slow inference and structural artifacts. Diffusion models (e.g., DiffRhythm), on the other hand, enable faster synthesis but often lack long-range structural coherence.

ACE-Step bridges this gap by integrating diffusion-based generation with Sana’s Deep Compression AutoEncoder (DCAE) and a lightweight linear transformer. It further leverages MERT and m-hubert to align semantic representations (REPA) during training, enabling rapid convergence. As a result, our model synthesizes up to 4 minutes of music in just 20 seconds on an A100 GPU—15× faster than LLM-based baselines—while achieving superior musical coherence and lyric alignment across melody, harmony, and rhythm metrics. Moreover, ACE-Step preserves fine-grained acoustic details, enabling advanced control mechanisms such as voice cloning, lyric editing, remixing, and track generation (e.g., lyric2vocal, singing2accompaniment).

Rather than building yet another end-to-end text-to-music pipeline, our vision is to establish a foundation model for music AI: a fast, general-purpose, efficient yet flexible architecture that makes it easy to train sub-tasks on top of it. This paves the way for developing powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators. In short, we aim to build the Stable Diffusion moment for music.

## 🖥️ Hardware Performance

We have evaluated ACE-Step across different hardware setups, yielding the following throughput results:

| Device          | RTF (27 steps) | Time to render 1 min audio (27 steps) | RTF (60 steps) | Time to render 1 min audio (60 steps) |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| NVIDIA RTX 4090 | 34.48 ×        | 1.74 s                                | 15.63 ×        | 3.84 s                                |
| NVIDIA A100     | 27.27 ×        | 2.20 s                                | 12.27 ×        | 4.89 s                                |
| NVIDIA RTX 3090 | 12.76 ×        | 4.70 s                                | 6.48 ×         | 9.26 s                                |
| MacBook M2 Max  | 2.27 ×         | 26.43 s                               | 1.03 ×         | 58.25 s                               |


We use RTF (Real-Time Factor) to measure the performance of ACE-Step. Higher values indicate faster generation speed. 27.27x means to generate 1 minute of music, it takes 2.2 seconds (60/27.27). The performance is measured on a single GPU with batch size 1 and 27 steps.


## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the ACE-Step repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step.git
cd ACE-Step
```

### 2. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

* `Python`: Version 3.10 or later is recommended. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* `Conda` or `venv`: For creating a virtual environment (Conda is recommended).

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts. Choose one of the following methods:

#### Option A: Using Conda

1.  **Create the environment** named `ace_step` with Python 3.10:
    ```bash
    conda create -n ace_step python=3.10 -y
    ```

2.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate ace_step
    ```

#### Option B: Using venv

1.  **Navigate to the cloned ACE-Step directory.**

2.  **Create the virtual environment** (commonly named `venv`):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv 
    ```

3.  **Activate the environment:**
    * **On Windows (cmd.exe):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 
        ```
        *(If you encounter execution policy errors, you might need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` first)*
    * **On Linux / macOS (bash/zsh):**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated:
**a.** (Windows Only) If you are on Windows and plan to use an NVIDIA GPU, install PyTorch with CUDA support first:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```
(Adjust cu126 if you have a different CUDA version. For other PyTorch installation options, refer to the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)).

**b.** Install ACE-Step and its core dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

The ACE-Step application is now installed. The GUI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For instructions on how to run it, please see the [Usage](#-usage) section.


## 🚀 Usage

![Demo Interface](assets/demo_interface.png)

### 🔍 Basic Usage

```bash
acestep --port 7865
```

### ⚙️ Advanced Usage

```bash
acestep --checkpoint_path /path/to/checkpoint --port 7865 --device_id 0 --share true --bf16 true
```

* If `--checkpoint_path` is set and models exist at the path, load from `checkpoint_path`.
* If `--checkpoint_path` is set but models do not exist at the path, auto download models to `checkpoint_path`.
* If `--checkpoint_path` is not set, auto download models to the default path `~/.cache/ace-step/checkpoints`.

If you are using macOS, please use `--bf16 false` to avoid errors.

#### 🔍 API Usage
If you intend to integrate ACE-Step as a library into your own Python projects, you can install the latest version directly from GitHub using the following pip command.

**Direct Installation via pip:**

1.  **Ensure Git is installed:** This method requires Git to be installed on your system and accessible in your system's PATH.
2.  **Execute the installation command:**
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step.git
    ```
    It's recommended to use this command within a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.

#### 🛠️ Command Line Arguments

- `--checkpoint_path`: Path to the model checkpoint (default: downloads automatically)
- `--server_name`: IP address or hostname for the Gradio server to bind to (default: '127.0.0.1'). Use '0.0.0.0' to make it accessible from other devices on the network.
